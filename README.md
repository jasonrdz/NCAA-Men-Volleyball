# About the project

During the course of this mini project, I think it is important to highlight a distinct feature I have always found really cool about volleyball: many things can win you a game, whether it be a killer outside in TJ Defalco or , a dominant righ-side we have seen in Gabi Garcia or Matthew Anderson, or even an amazing setter in Micah Christenson or Jakob Thelle. However, one thing that is a consisent serving and passing is the underlying determinant in the outcome of a volleyball game. In the Men's game, it is so important to serve tough and in, given the shorted point play, so with this project, I want to see if we can predict the winner of the current years NCAA Championship based on the serving of the team.

# End Goal
As this script is continously being made with changes and new improvements, the end goal is to attempt to automate a process as the NCAA updates the weekly aces leaderboard. Also, given the flow of the project, I may look to shift my focus to other areas of the sport to hone in other attributes of the game, such as kills and assists, where we can also look and analyze said categories. Given the data is scraped from the NCAA page, bugs and errors may occur given the status of the page or automation process I decide to proceed with.

Overall, I just look to have those who love volleyball a cool thing to look at and talk about :)
